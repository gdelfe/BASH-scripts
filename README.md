# This repo contains a series of files for the preprocessing of the brain fMRI data

get_act_time_series: it extract the active time series from the fMRI image BOLD signal, i.e. only the time series for the voxels above the correlation threshold or, in other words, below the p-value threshold

extract_data: it extract all the active voxels from the brain fMRI image, course grain them, and marges the value of the voxel coordinates with their corresponding correlation value
